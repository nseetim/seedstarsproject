1.  After Downloading or pulling the repo install the requirements
    from the requirements file,
2.  Setup Postgresql on your local machine for linux Debian based OS
    apt-get install psql should do it, windows users could google it
3.  Start the DBMS with the default created user "postgres" for linux
    Debian based OS users sudo -u postgres psql should do it
4.  create your database and take note of the password and the user and change
    these entries in the settings.py file to match yours or you could
    just change the Database engine and use the sqlite db to avoid the stress
    for the sqlite the setting will should be like this

                        DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                    'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
                }
            }

5.  Final note: It would be nice to work with a virtual env, its helps alot
